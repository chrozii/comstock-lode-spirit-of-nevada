        <h2>Discovering a Legend</h2>
        <img src="https://example.com/comstock-lode-image.jpg" alt="The Comstock Lode" class="hero-image">
        <p>The Comstock Lode, discovered in 1859, is one of the most significant and exciting mining finds in history! This massive silver deposit was found in the rugged hills near Virginia City, Nevada, and it literally sparked a silver rush that helped shape the future of Nevada and the American West. Imagine the excitement of hundreds of miners striking it rich overnight—this discovery would forever alter the course of history!</p>

        <h2>Historical Impact</h2>
        <p>The Comstock Lode was a game-changer for both Nevada and the nation as a whole. This incredible find made Nevada the epicenter of the silver industry and brought in millions of dollars of silver, propelling the United States into an economic boom. In fact, the Comstock Lode’s wealth funded the development of the Transcontinental Railroad and played a major role in the building of cities across the West!</p>

        <p>Key moments in Comstock Lode history include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The discovery of rich silver veins by Henry Comstock and two Irish prospectors, Peter O'Riley and Patrick McLaughlin.</li>
            <li>Virginia City booming into a vibrant town full of saloons, hotels, and businesses eager to cater to the rush of miners and fortune seekers.</li>
            <li>The infamous “Silver Kings,” who became wealthy beyond imagination, but also faced tremendous challenges and conflicts.</li>
            <li>The incredible rise of mining technology, such as the development of the Cornish pump, which allowed miners to reach deeper than ever before!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Ores Produced and Their Values</h2>
        <p>The Comstock Lode primarily produced silver and gold, but miners also extracted a variety of other ores. The following highlights the key ores and their values:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Silver</span>: The most significant production from the Comstock Lode, estimated at over **300 million ounces of silver** over the years. At the peak of silver prices, this was worth **about $500 million** (in 19th-century dollars), equivalent to billions today!</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Gold</span>: The Comstock Lode also contained significant amounts of gold. It is estimated that miners extracted approximately **10 million ounces of gold**. At historic gold prices, this could be valued around **$200 million**, or more, depending on the market.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Other Ores</span>: Additionally, the lode yielded small quantities of lead, copper, and zinc, which were extracted as by-products of silver mining. While their value was much lower compared to silver and gold, they still contributed to the mine’s overall success.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In today's market, the value of these ores has drastically increased, and the Comstock Lode remains one of the richest deposits in the history of mining.</p>

        <h2>Contributions to Nevada</h2>
        <p>The Comstock Lode not only made millionaires, but it also laid the foundation for Nevada's statehood in 1864. It provided the wealth necessary to build infrastructure, create schools, and develop a robust economy. Silver was so crucial to Nevada that it became the state’s defining resource—known as the “Silver State” to this day!</p>

        <p>Beyond the economic impact, the Comstock Lode inspired a spirit of adventure, resilience, and innovation. It is a symbol of how dreams can be realized with hard work and a little bit of luck, even in the harshest of environments.</p>
